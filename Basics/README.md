## Data types
[Codes Here](my_training_code.js) ðŸ’›    
Javascript has dynamic typing. Data types are automatically assigned to variables.
These two variable have different data type but we dont specified their data types.

`
var name = "Kayse"  
`  
`
var number = 15
`

**Difference Primitive data types of JavaScripts are:**
 * Number
 * String
 * Boolean
 * Undefined
    * a declared variable but doesn't have a value yet
 * Null
    * meaning not exist

**Comments**

In Javascript it has two types of making comment in the code

single-line comment 
`\\this single line comment` 

and multiple line comment   
` 
/* 
this's multple comment line
`  
`
another comment line 
*/
`

**Operators**  
`var year = 2021`    
`console.log(year-26)` // output   
`typeof year` // _output_ Number


**Functions**
 if we have lot of codes that we should run couple of times we create function with parameters if necessary then called the function when even is needed.

 `
 function helloFunction(name){  
    console.log("hello"+name)  
 }  
 `


**Array**  
it's like collection of Variables
`var names = ['Kayse', 'Jane']`

**Objects**  
like array instead of accessing the elemant by index, you can access by specific name. And also wont have order as Array.  
`var obj = {  
   'name':'kayse'
}`

**Loops Andoooooooooooooon**  
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly(MDN). instead of writing couple of times same code, looping through is better.
  
`
for(var i=0; i<10;i++){  
   console.log(i)
}`

 ## Tricks and Tips

`var a = 10  
 var b = "10"  
 if(a==b)
`  
this comparison my not always good or efficiency  this will only good if you know the return of comparisons, so using __===__ maybe better.

## Data types
Javascript has dynamic typing. Data types are automatically assigned to variables.
These two variable have different data type but we dont specified their data types.

`
var name = "Kayse"  
`  
`
var number = 15
`

**Difference Primitive data types of JavaScripts are:**
 * Number
 * String
 * Boolean
 * Undefined
    * a declared variable but doesn't have a value yet
 * Null
    * meaning not exist

**Comments**

In Javascript it has two types of making comment in the code

single-line comment 
`\\this single line comment` 

and multiple line comment   
` 
/* 
this's multple comment line
`  
`
another comment line 
*/
`

**Operators**  
`var year = 2021`    
`console.log(year-26)` // output   
`typeof year` // _output_ Number
